# üé® ArtVault üï∏Ô∏è

ArtVault aims to bring transparency and efficiency to the art market by creating a digital record of ownership that can be validated by anyone with access to the blockchain. This eliminates the need for intermediaries in the art market and makes it easier for investors to buy and sell shares of artwork without the usual barriers of high transaction costs and lengthy legal processes.

Furthermore, ArtVault's platform offers an innovative way for artists to monetize their work through the creation of digital shares. This allows them to retain ownership of their artwork while still benefiting from its appreciation in value.
